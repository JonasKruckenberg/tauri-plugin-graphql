Switch from [`juniper`](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql) to [`async-graphql`](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper). This adds integration with more crates, including the `log`, `tracing` and `opentelemetry` ecosystems. It also improves performance and simplifies the implementation.
